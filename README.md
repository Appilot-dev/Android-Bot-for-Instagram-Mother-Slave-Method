This repository is currently active, and development is ongoing

**Welcome** to my journey of developing an **Android automation bot for Instagram’s Mother-Slave (M/S) Method**, I’ve been manually growing my clients’ Instagram accounts and brands using the M/S method. However, after exploring the market for an automation bot that could simplify and automate this process, I found that most existing solutions were not only difficult to learn but also lacked the specific features I needed.

### Here are a few key aspects I want my bot to include:

1. **Remote Management:** I’d like to manage Android phones remotely through a dashboard, rather than relying on a single laptop.
2. **Battery Efficiency:** I’m looking for alternatives to ADB for automation, as it tends to drain my phone’s battery and affect its overall health.
3. **Enhanced Features:** The bot should support features like uploading and watching reels, which can make a significant difference.
4. **Compatibility:** It should be compatible with the latest versions of Instagram, not just older ones.
5. **Cost-Effective Solutions:** Alternatives like app cloners are expensive and cumbersome, so I’m aiming for a more efficient approach.
6. **Simplified Onboarding:** The onboarding process for many existing tools is overly complex, with difficult installations and confusing documentation. I believe this is because the niche is still relatively new and research-based, with few people truly understanding it.  Given these challenges, I’ve decided to build my own bot from the ground up.

I will be sharing the entire journey, including insights, challenges, and discussions on this thread on **[BlackHatWorld](https://www.blackhatworld.com/members/app_pilot.1954567/)** (BHW) and through this series on **[Medium](https://medium.com/@appilot/mother-slave-methodandroid-bot-for-instagrams-mother-slave-method-9a7546cc8277)**, where I regularly post updates and release dates. If you’d like to contribute to this journey, feel free to engage on either platform. I’d love to have your support along the way.

As a token of appreciation, everyone who interacts, offers advice, or joins me on this journey will receive free access to the tool once it’s fully developed
