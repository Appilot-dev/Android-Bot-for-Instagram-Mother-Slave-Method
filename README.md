Mobile Bot for Instagram Mother Slave Method  This repository is currently active, and development is ongoing

**Welcome** to my journey of developing an **Android automation bot for Instagram’s Mother-Slave (M/S) Method**, I’ve been manually growing my clients’ Instagram accounts and brands using the M/S method. However, after exploring the market for an automation bot that could simplify and automate this process, I found that most existing solutions were not only difficult to learn but also lacked the specific features I needed.

### Here are a few key aspects I want my bot to include:

1. **Remote Management:** I’d like to manage Android phones remotely through a dashboard, rather than relying on a single laptop.
2. **Battery Efficiency:** I’m looking for alternatives to ADB for automation, as it tends to drain my phone’s battery and affect its overall health.
3. **Enhanced Features:** The bot should support features like uploading and watching reels, which can make a significant difference.
4. **Compatibility:** It should be compatible with the latest versions of Instagram, not just older ones.
5. **Cost-Effective Solutions:** Alternatives like app cloners are expensive and cumbersome, so I’m aiming for a more efficient approach.
6. **Simplified Onboarding:** The onboarding process for many existing tools is overly complex, with difficult installations and confusing documentation. I believe this is because the niche is still relatively new and research-based, with few people truly understanding it.  Given these challenges, I’ve decided to build my own bot from the ground up.
